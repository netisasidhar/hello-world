Well, I wanted to keep this file public, as, I wanted the world to know that I had this Idea. If someone had this idea already, please let me know and forgive me.
Now, to the idea-
it is of a filesystem that has two distinct kinds of clusters-
-pointer cluseters
-data clusters.
Pointer clusters only store pointers to other clusters (pointer or data) while data clusters only store data.
For simplicity, lets say that one cluster is just a 512 byte sector(for now).
A file begins in this filesystem by one pointer cluster having 8-byte-pointers to 64 clusters - the second layer.
If  the layer is of pointer clusters, each of those has pointers to the next layer of clusters -by now I think you know what I mean by a layer-
going like this, finally we reach the data layer, now, which layer is the data layer- that the directory stores(it stores the number of the layer having data).
The directory itself is a thing just like a file. with the exception- the data clusters only store file pointers and their names and the layer number of data layer.
Now, another bit of the idea is that we can not only have this as a layered structure, but also as a thing like- each pointer cluster has pointers to just data clusters 
with the last pointer being to another pointer cluster. And then we have a "freefile" where all unused clusters in the middle of being-used clusters are linked to 
increase speed of finding a free cluster.
