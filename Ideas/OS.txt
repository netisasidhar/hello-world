I do not know most existing operating systems but I want to build my own self contained operating system to cater my specific needs using my old desktop.

Some core ideas of my OS
1) No files. Only objects. OS fetches them from disk and you can use them. Apps cannot access the mechanism which the OS uses to maintain these.
2) The OS by itself is uninteractive, and is precompiled- you can change this using appropriate apps.
3) Each app loads the next at boot time.
4) It is possible that I use my filesystem for this OS- not as a FILESYSTEM but as the thing which manages public objects on disk.

I know things like CosmOS exist; but I want this to make things light and to have control at the level of the boot sector.

A thing that I found useful- How to load your first "Hello world.bin" file to an actual computer?
Most people will suggest a proceure involving ISO files, andgoing forward, this might be the only solution, but for now, what I did is-
1) Go get Tiny-Core linux(if I spelled it right)'s ISO file.
2) Burn it on a CD-R
3) Get the .bin file containing my operating system as it would exist on the hard disk of the target computer in a pen drive(usb stick).
4) Boot the CD and plug in the pen drive.
5) Use- dd if=/mnt/sdb1/myos.bin of=/dev/sda bs=512
sdb1 is the pendrive; myos.bin is my OS;sda is the hard disk where I want my OS to be.
6) Reboot after removing the CD.
